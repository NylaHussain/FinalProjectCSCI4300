Final Project for CSCI 4300

A full-stack program built with Next.js and MongoDB that allows users to sign up, log in, manage sessions with JWT tokens, and interact with personalized pantry and recipe collection. 

The purpose of Pantry Poppers is to provide students on campus with a resource to organize their ingredients and find recipes based off of what is in their kitchen. If an ingredient is needed, they can add it to their pantry to keep track of what they need to purchase.
